    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of explicitly programming every rule. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with data and clearly defined rules to get the correct output. However, in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with data along with the correct answers, and the system automatically learns the underlying rules or patterns from that data. This allows machines to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data without being manually programmed for every possible scenario."
